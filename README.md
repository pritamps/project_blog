This sets up a simple Multi-User blog on the Google App Engine.

## Functionality

The following functionality is supported

1. User creation, authentication
2. Users can create posts
3. Users can edit and delete posts
4. Users can comment on both their own and others' posts
5. Users can delete posts that they have created
6. Users can like others' posts. If a user has already liked a post, the text "Liked!" is displayed. If the current post is of the same user, no "Like" is available even though the number of likes is visible
7. Users can edit and delete their own comments. If the functionality is available, it is displayed below the comment

Parts 1 and 2 were provided as starter code, and the rest has been added by me.
